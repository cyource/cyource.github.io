In this new post, for my EECS project, I shall be explaining how I developed my blog, and what tools and resources I used to make it what it is.
<br>
<br>
First of all - as Jekyll is a ruby gem, I had to install Ruby onto my PC first. I've had no experience with Ruby, and In the process of developing this blog, I understood how it worked - but the blog istelf didn't really require any Ruby code....
