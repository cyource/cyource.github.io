My phone, the 2015 Moto G 4G LTE ("**thea**") doesn't exactly have a lot of custom ROM support. Fortunately, it had official CM/Lineage builds, as well as some unofficial variants, but apart from a MIUI 8 port and one or two others... that was it. Not that I'm complaining - but thea is limited to only a few ROMs compared to other devices - which is totally understandable, considering its age. In fact, its popularity is the reason why builds are still actively developed for it! Now, yesterday, while browsing through XDA, I stumbled upon something. Something that could serve as a bit of a change from LineageOS 14.1. I found a Nougat 7.1.2 build (labelled as OFFICIAL, though I'm not entirely sure if it actually is) of Resurrection Remix 5.8.3. 

In the past, some of my friends ran RR on their phones and told me to get it, but I was content with CyanogenMod/Lineage. Now... I realise how right they were.

Resurrection Remix has the best of Lineage, Slim and Omni, as well as its many unique features, settings and options. In other words - it is the ultimate customization ROM, right up there with Paranoid Android. It even has a whole mega-section of settings dedicated to customization - which contains multiple sections for customizing different elements of the OS, from the lock screen to the navbar to the notification panel and much more! It brang back features that CM/Lineage dropped, such as Quick Unlock, PIN Scrambling and Pie Controls. RR uses Magisk, a Modules and Root manager, that does what both Xposed (which isn't yet supported in Nougat) and SuperSU do!

I've heard some complaints about RR that state, even though it's the top dog when it comes to customization, it's slow and laggy. Well, my phone's speed and performance hasn't been slower or sluggish in any way since I flashed RR (though it could be attributed to the use of Root Booster). 

So far, I haven't encountered any issues in this build. Well, apart from the custom tiles (below the line) dissapearing halfway through the process of being dragged up to the panel. But other than that - everything works like a charm. It sure looks like I'm gonna be sticking with this ROM for quite a while.
