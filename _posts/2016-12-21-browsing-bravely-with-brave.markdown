I've been through a lot of browsers on my computer this year, let alone my phone. From Chrome to Firefox to Chrome to Chromium to (very, very, very briefly) Torch to (very briefly) Liri and then back to Chromium - it's been quite a ride. But I've finally found the right browser. Brave.

With a built-in ad/tracker-blocker, enhanced privacy settings, a great, and different, UI, this Chromium-based browser is everything anyone could possible want of a browser. Being in beta phase, it would be expected to have a couple of rough edges - but so far, all I've noticed is a startup delayed by a second or two alone, and (admittedly) a bit of lag with YouTube. The app lives up to it's status of being fast, saving time and protecting your online privacy and security. In fact, the browser won my over so much that I even installed it on my phone and tablet (basically native Chromium on those devices **in design**, however). Another problem is that wikitext and code-formatted text appear... stretched out a bit too much. Hopefully that'll be fixed soon - I myself would contribute if one of my languages of proficiency was JavaScript (what the laptop version of Brave's mostly written in: GitHub link [here](https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop)).

Another reason why I prefer Brave is because, it's very different from any other browser based on Chromium. For users of Firefox specifically, Brave can be described as "the Chromium Firefox". Anyway - I would highly recommend Brave to anyone - specifically PC users. Happy browsing. Oh - and get it [here](https://brave.com).
