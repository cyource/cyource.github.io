This blog was created in June 2016, using Jekyll - "a blog-aware, static site generator" (that's the official description), and is hosted on gh-pages. In order to locally run it, to test changes before pushing them live, Git on Bash on Ubuntu on Windows is used - read [this post](/general/2016/06/18/hello-jekyll.html) to see how this blog came to be. Though featuring posts on a variety of different topics (or intended to, anyway), the primary focus was supposed to be technology, whether it's app development, modding or Custom ROM power-using. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/manasrawat/manasrawat.github.io).
