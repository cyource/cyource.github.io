Hi there. I'm Manas, a 15 year old from South East England currently doing my GCSEs. One of my free time hobbies is computer programming - though nowadays, I do a lot less than I used to. Other things I do to kill time include watching television series, frequenting reddit, chatting with my friends or just aimlessly browsing the web.

I created this blog back in June 2016, using Jekyll - "a blog-aware, static site generator" (that's the official description), and host it on gh-pages. In order to locally run it, to test changes before pushing them live, I used Git on Bash on Ubuntu on Windows - read [this post](/general/2016/06/18/hello-jekyll.html) to see how this blog came to be. Though featuring posts on a variety of different topics (or intended to, anyway), the primary focus will always be technology, whether it's app development, modding or Custom ROM power-using. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/manasrawat/manasrawat.github.io).
