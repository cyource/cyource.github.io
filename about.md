My name is **Manas Rawat** (aka **munowse**), and I'm a student, Android developer and web designer. Nowdays, I primarily code in C#, for school projects, stepping aside from Java and Android development for a while. Aside from programming, in my free time, I'm usually either watching YouTube/television (usually *Arrowverse* series), communicating with friends via WhatsApp, "experimenting" with my phone, reading comics, and more.

I created **River Logs** back in June 2016, using Jekyll - "a blog-aware, static site generator" (that's the official description), along with Google's mdl library and gh-pages. In order to locally run it, to test changes before pushing them live, I used Git on Bash on Ubuntu on Windows - read [this post](/general/2016/06/18/hello-jekyll.html) to see how this blog came to be. Though featuring posts on a variety of different topics (or intended to, anyway), the primary focus will always be technology, whether it's app development, modding or Custom ROM power-using. The source code for this blog can be found [here](https://github.com/munowse/munowse.github.io). This blog underwent a major design overhaul on the 30th of January, 2017, in which I switched it's base from the default Jekyll theme to Jekyll Now and dropped usage of the mdl library.
