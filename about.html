				I created River Logs (simply titled "<b>Manas Rawat's Blog</b>" back then) in June 2016, using Jekyll - "a blog-aware, static site generator" (that's the official description), along with Google's mdl library and gh-pages. In order to locally run it, to test changes before pushing them live, I used Git on Bash on Ubuntu on Windows - read <a href="/general/2016/06/18/hello-jekyll.html">this post</a> to see how this blog came to be. Though featuring posts on a variety of different topics (or intended to, anyway), the primary focus will always be technology, whether it's app development, modding or Custom ROM power-using. The source code for this blog can be found <a href="https://github.com/munowse/munowse.github.io">here</a>.

				My name is Manas Rawat (aka "<b>munowse</b>" and <b>"cyource"</b>), and I'm a UK-based indepedent computer programmer and app developer with a passion for maths, science and programming, that loves comic book media (especially The CW's <i>The Flash</i> and <i>DC's Legends of Tomorrow</i>). When I'm not coding away, I'm usually either on <b>freenode</b> IRCs <b>#android</b>, <b>#android-dev</b> and <b>#cyanogenmod</b> channels, watching videos, talking to friends and playing games on my phone, reading (comics and books) or swimming.

				I primarily code in object-orientated languages including <b>Java</b>, <b>C#</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>C++</b> and some <b>Python</b>. For web development (i.e. that of this blog), I use (as most people do) <b>HTML</b> & <b>CSS</b>, with some <b>Liquid</b>. In addition to these languages, I also have a bit of experience with <b>JavaScript</b>. The source code for this blog and many of my projects can be found on <a href="https://github.com/munowse">my GitHub</a>. As shown by the look and fell of my blog and apps, I'm quite well-versed in <b>UI/X design</b>.
