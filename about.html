				I created this blog in June 2016, using Jekyll - "a blog-aware, static site generator" (that's the official description), along with Google's mdl library and gh-pages. In order to locally run it, to test changes before pushing them live, I used Git on Bash on Ubuntu on Windows - read <a href="/general/2016/06/18/hello-jekyll.html">this post</a> to see how this blog came to be. Though featuring posts on a variety of different topics (or intended to, anyway), the primary focus is, was, and will always be technology. The source code for this blog can be found <a href="https://github.com/cyource">here</a>.

				My name is Manas Rawat (aka "<b>cyource</b>"), and I'm a UK-based indepedent computer programmer and Android Developer with a passion for maths, science and programming, that loves comic book media (especially <i>CW's The Flash</i> and <i>DC's Legends of Tomorrow</i>). When I'm not coding away, I can usually be found on <b>freenode</b> IRC channels, asking for, or giving help.

				I primarily code in object-orientated languages including <b>Java</b> <i>(for GUI Android Apps)</i>, <b>C++</b> <i>(for Native Android command-line/terminal apps)</i>, <b>C, C#</b>, and some <b>Python</b>. I use styling, templating and markup languages for both web development - <b>CSS, Liquid and HTML</b> - and for the look and feel of GUI Android Apps - <b>XML</b>. In addition to these languages, I also have some experience with <b>JavaScript</b>. The source code for this blog and many of my projects can be found on <a href="https://github.com/cyource">my GitHub</a>. I am also pretty well-versed in using <b>Shell, Bash and ADB</b>, and - as shown by the look and feel of this blog, my GUI Android Apps, and icons/logos I created - in user interface design.
