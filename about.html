				I created River Logs (simply titled "<b>Manas Rawat's Blog</b>" back then) in June 2016, using Jekyll - "a blog-aware, static site generator" (that's the official description), along with Google's mdl library and gh-pages. In order to locally run it, to test changes before pushing them live, I used Git on Bash on Ubuntu on Windows - read <a href="/general/2016/06/18/hello-jekyll.html">this post</a> to see how this blog came to be. Though featuring posts on a variety of different topics (or intended to, anyway), the primary focus will always be computing/programming, whether it's Android development or Windows power-using. The source code for this blog can be found <a href="https://github.com/cyource/cyource.github.io">here</a>.

				My name is Manas Rawat (aka "<b>munowse</b>" and <b>"cyource"</b>), and I'm a UK-based indepedent computer programmer and app developer with a passion for maths, science and programming, that loves comic book media (especially The CW's <i>The Flash</i> and <i>DC's Legends of Tomorrow</i>). When I'm not coding away, I'm usually either on <b>freenode</b> IRCs <b>#android</b>, <b>#android-dev</b> and <b>#cyanogenmod</b> channels, watching youtube, talking to friends and playing games on my phone, reading (comics and books), swimming (not too much nowdays, though) or watching my favourite DC television shows, among other things.

				I primarily code in object-orientated languages including <b>Java</b>, <b>C#</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>C++</b> and some <b>Python</b>. I use styling, templating and markup languages for both web development (working on my blog) - <b>CSS, Liquid and HTML</b> - and for the look and feel of GUI Android Apps - <b>XML</b>. In addition to these languages, I also have a bit of experience with <b>JavaScript</b>. The source code for this blog and many of my projects can be found on <a href="https://github.com/cyource">my GitHub</a>. I am also pretty well-versed in using <b>Shell, Bash and ADB</b>, and - as shown by the look and feel of this blog, my GUI Android Apps, and icons/logos I created - in user interface design.
